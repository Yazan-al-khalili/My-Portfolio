          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am Yazan Alkhalili, a driven computer engineering student at
            Karlstad University with a strong passion for technology and
            problem-solving. My academic journey has provided me with a solid
            foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of the field,
            allowing me to develop skills in programming, data analysis,
            database management, and systems development. I am always eager to
            explore new technologies and methodologies, focusing on applying my
            knowledge to create efficient, innovative, and user-centered
            solutions. <br />
            <br />
            With experience in both frontend and backend development, I have
            gained a comprehensive understanding of how various technologies
            seamlessly integrate. I thrive both independently and in
            collaborative environments, leveraging agile methodologies to
            maintain structured yet flexible workflows in my projects. <br />
            <br />
            Beyond my technical expertise, I have developed strong
            problem-solving and teamwork skills through my experience as a
            warehouse worker and grocery associate. These roles have
            strengthened my ability to work efficiently under pressure, adapt to
            dynamic environments, and collaborate effectively with diverse
            teams. My hands-on experience in fast-paced settings has also
            enhanced my organizational skills and attention to detail, qualities
            that I carry into my work as a computer engineer. <br />

          <h3>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering</h3>
          <p class="university">Karlstad University, Sweden</p>
          <p class="year">2022 - 2025</p>
          <p>
            During my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, I have gained
            expertise in algorithms, data structures, programming, operating
            systems, and networking. The curriculum focuses on software
            development, embedded systems, and database management, equipping me
            with a strong technical skillset that bridges both hardware and
            software domains.
            <br />
            <br />I will begin working on my Bachelorâ€™s thesis in September
            2025, aiming to complete it by January 2026. This research project
            will allow me to apply my knowledge to a real-world problem,
            refining my ability to conduct in-depth analysis, develop innovative
            solutions, and deliver high-quality results. By integrating both
            theoretical learning and practical application, I am preparing to
            enter the industry with a well-rounded understanding of modern
            computer engineering challenges and solutions.
